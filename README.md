# Earthquake Heatmap Visualization Project

This project visualizes earthquake data on a heatmap using React for the front end and Express for the back end. The earthquake data is fetched from the USGS API and displayed using Leaflet with a heatmap layer.

# Backend 

The backend is built using Express and serves an endpoint to fetch earthquake data from the USGS API. In backend directory server.js

# Frontend 

The frontend is built using React and TypeScript. It fetches the data from the backend and visualizes it on a Leaflet map with a heatmap layer.
